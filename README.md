# Injury Prediction in Athletes
-------------------------------
## Overview
This project explores how **Training Hours per Week** and **Recovery Days per Week** affect the **probability of injuries** among athletes.  
The analysis uses **descriptive statistics** and **single-factor ANOVA / correlation tests** to identify which variables have the most influence on injury risk.



## Goal
To identify the reasons behind Athletes injuries and whether athletes with higher training loads or fewer recovery days are more likely to experience injuries, and to quantify how much recovery contributes to injury prevention.
